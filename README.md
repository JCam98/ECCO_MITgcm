# ECCO_MITgcm
 This repository contains Python, Matlab, and Fortran source code that leverages the MITgcm General Circulation Model code repository for building, running, and post-processing results from numerical models that are used to study ocean dynamics. The contents of this repository are broken up into four general categories according to their end use, namely, software tailored for: 
 
1) The personal use of the author's manager (Dr. Patrick Heimbach)
2) The CRIOS Group community at the University of Texas at Austin's Oden Institute 
for Computational Engineering and Sciences
3) Particular Checkpoint Releases of the MITgcm master code repository
4) Assimilation into the MITgcm master code repository for general use
